   - Upload: File upload interface with progress tracking
   - Projections: Sales forecasting and trend analysis
   - Historical: View and manage previous uploads
   - Account: User profile and settings

2. **Reusable UI Components**:
   - `KPICard`: Display individual metrics with appropriate formatting

   - `ForecastChart`: Display sales projections with confidence intervals
   - `StyleForecastChart`: Visualize product style trends
   - `AggregatorBlock`: Dynamic component for rendering different KPI types

3. **Custom Hooks**:
   - `useUpload`: Handle file uploads and progress tracking
   - `useAnalyticsFull`: Fetch complete analytics data
   - `useAnalyticsCustom`: Fetch specific analytics metrics
   - `useHistoricalUploads`: Retrieve previous upload history
   - `useProjections`: Generate and retrieve sales forecasts

## Data Flow

1. **Upload Process**:
   - User uploads Shopify order export file
   - File is stored in Supabase storage
   - Background worker processes the file, parsing orders and line items
   - Progress is tracked and reported to the frontend
   - Upon completion, user is redirected to the dashboard

2. **Analytics Generation**:
   - User selects an upload to analyze
   - Frontend requests analytics data from the API
   - Backend retrieves raw data from the database
   - Analytics service applies aggregation functions
   - Results are cached in Redis for improved performance
   - Frontend renders visualizations and KPIs

3. **Forecasting Process**:
   - User selects an upload and forecast type
   - Backend loads historical data from the database
   - Time series or style-based forecasting models are applied
   - Projections are generated with confidence intervals
   - Frontend renders forecast charts and insights

## Deployment Architecture

The application uses a modern cloud-native deployment approach:

- **Railway Platform**: PaaS for hosting the backend API and worker processes
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting with automatic deployments
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database and file storage
- **Redis Cloud**: Managed Redis service for caching and queues

### Deployment Components

1. **Web API Service**: Handles HTTP requests and API endpoints
2. **Worker Service**: Processes background jobs and long-running tasks
