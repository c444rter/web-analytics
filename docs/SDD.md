## 6.1 Introduction

This document presents the architecture and detailed design for the Shopify Analytics App. The system is designed to process Shopify export files, aggregate analytics data (with integrated machine learning projections), and serve dynamic dashboards. The primary focus is on the backend (including machine learning), the database, and finally the frontend.

### 6.1.1 System Objectives

- **Objective:** The application will efficiently import large Shopify export files (up to and beyond 13,000 records) by employing bulk data ingestion techniques.
- **Analytics:** It will aggregate and present comprehensive analytics data in both a default mode (all KPIs) and a custom KPI selection mode.
- **Machine Learning:** Integrated machine learning algorithms will generate projections based on historical data.
- **Historical Uploads:** Users will be able to select and view historical uploads.
- **User Interface:** The Next.js/React frontend will deliver a responsive dashboard and a file upload interface with real-time progress tracking.

### 6.1.2 Hardware, Software, and Human Interfaces

#### 6.1.2.1 Hardware Interfaces

- **General:** The application is developed and deployed locally (using a client laptop) and on servers managed via Docker. No specialized hardware interfaces are required beyond standard keyboard, mouse, and display devices.

#### 6.1.2.2 Software Interfaces

- **Backend Interfaces:** RESTful HTTP/HTTPS APIs provided by FastAPI, documented via Swagger.
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pandas, Redis/RQ, Next.js, React, Materialâ€‘UI, @tanstack/react-query, Axios.
- **Protocols:** Data is exchanged using JSON over HTTP.

#### 6.1.2.3 Human Interfaces

- The system provides a modern, responsive GUI. The primary screens are:
  - **Upload Screen:** Allows users to select and upload Shopify export files. A progress bar and percentage indicator are shown during processing.
  - **Dashboard:** Displays analytics in the form of KPI cards, line charts, and tables with both default and custom KPI modes.
  - **Historical Uploads:** Offers a dropdown to select and review previous uploads.
- Usability considerations include intuitive navigation and immediate feedback upon file upload.

---

## 6.2 Architectural Design

The system is partitioned into the following main components:

### 6.2.1 Major Software Components

- **Backend (FastAPI):**  
  Handles file uploads, bulk data ingestion, progress tracking, analytics aggregation, and integrated machine learning projections.
- **Machine Learning Module:**  
  Integrated within the backend to generate future projections based on historical data.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):**  
  Stores all persistent data including Users, Uploads, Orders, and LineItems, with support for bulk inserts and query indexing.
- **Frontend (Next.js/React):**  
  Displays the file upload interface (with real-time progress) and the analytics dashboard. Utilizes TanStack Query for data fetching and Axios for API communication.

### 6.2.2 Major Software Interactions

Components interact primarily through RESTful endpoints:

- The **Frontend** uploads files to the **Backend**; the backend enqueues tasks via Redis/RQ.
- The **Backend** processes files by ingesting data into the **Database** (using bulk inserts) and updates progress fields.
- The **Frontend** polls the **Backend** (using a specific status endpoint) to display real-time progress.
- The **Analytics API** aggregates data from the **Database** and, when applicable, integrates machine learning projections.
- The **Machine Learning Module** processes historical data and outputs projections that are merged into analytics results.

      int order_id FK
      int lineitem_quantity
      string lineitem_name
      string lineitem_price
      numeric lineitem_discount
      ... additional line item fields ...
    }
```

### 6.4.2 Database Access

- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy is used for all database interactions.
- **Connection:** FastAPI obtains database sessions through a SessionLocal factory.
- **Bulk Operations:** The system uses SQLAlchemyâ€™s `bulk_insert_mappings` for efficient bulk inserts, especially during file ingestion.
- **Queries:** Aggregated analytics are performed via SQL functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) and custom ORM queries.

### 6.4.3 Database Security

- The database employs role-based access controls and secured connection credentials.
- Authentication is enforced on API endpoints via token-based methods (such as JWT).
- Sensitive data (e.g., user passwords) is stored securely using hashing.
- Network-level controls ensure that only authorized services can access the PostgreSQL server.

- Detailed architectural diagrams and interaction sequences.
- API documentation generated by Swagger (via FastAPI).
- Performance and profiling reports for bulk data ingestion and ML projection modules.
