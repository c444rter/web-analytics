Project Proposal Feedback
Project: DAVIDS
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   EXCELLENT work here, Carter!  You really nailed it on this deliverable.
   Impressive description and you break the document down logically so that
   the reader gets the full idea.  The justification is great, too!  I like
   the acronym...  :D

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Presentation is eye-catching and well-constructed, reflecting the care
   you have put into it.  I like the fact that you use different backgrounds
   within the presentation ~ keeps the audience interested!  The graphics
   are also very nice, interesting to the audience... although there's quite
   a bit of small text on slide two, I think it's fine since it breaks up
   the repetitive 'bullet list' format of the presentation.

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall, and a very interesting project idea!
Great start to the semester, Carter!
