   Total Percentage:  0/15 = 100% which is an F on this deliverable.

I can't evaluate what isn't there.

You have nothing for either the SRS or for either of the SDD documents in
the repository.  You'll need to do a full SRS for deliverable #5 and a full
architectural and detailed design document for deliverable #4 to get any
credit for those documents for your project this semester.
